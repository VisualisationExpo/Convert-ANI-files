# Convert-ANI-files
Quick instructions on how you can convert Windows' ANI files for use with Mousecape

## Let's try and get a Windows .ANI file converted to something useful on macOS




> There's of course some things I might have skipped below; where to place your files after they've been converted. The default setting is to place all images in the 'source' directory i.e where the ANI file is located. This could make a mess of things so perhaps create a folder for your ANI file to begin with so that everything is contained in one directory.



Let's try and get a Windows .ANI file converted to individual PNG or TIFF files with the use of the free multi-operating system application called XnConvert.

>Download XnConvert from https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xnconvert/id436203431?mt=12 

XnView isn't exclusive to MacAppStore as it's a multi-operating system application/program and as such the interface is thereafter.
This particular tutorial is based off the non-Mac App Store application as I only found out about being there after the fact.

>You can download XnView here too, should you prefer to not use the Mac App Store: [XnConvert via the XnView website](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/)


* Have your Windows .ani file ready and XnConvert ready too. The following images shows what my settings are for the link provided here:

> Watch these following images.  This is a tutorial made on the notion that the specific file is downloaded.



# First up is the step to accessing the .ani file that you just downloaded from the link above or any other .ani file that you might have downloaded.
